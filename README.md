# Composite-Behavioral-Modeling-of-Identity-theft-detection-in-online-social-networks
Our academic project focuses on detecting identity theft in social online networks using composite behavior modeling. We analyze various user behaviors such as login patterns, posting frequency, and social interactions to create comprehensive behavior profiles. By comparing these profiles to established norms, our model can flag suspicious activities indicative of identity theft. Through rigorous evaluation, we aim to provide an effective and scalable solution to enhance cybersecurity in social online networks.
